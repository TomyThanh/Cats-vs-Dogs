# Cats-vs-Dogs


Image Classification: Cats vs. Dogs (TensorFlow)
This project implements an image classifier that distinguishes cats and dogs based on photographs. Using TensorFlow and Keras, I am building a convolutional neural network (CNN) that learns to recognize typical characteristics of both animal classes from a training dataset. The project includes:

Data preprocessing and augmentation (e.g., rotation, scaling)

Building and training a CNN with multiple convolution and pooling layers

Evaluating model performance with accuracy, precision, and recall

Visualizing training progress and results

A practical example of deep learning with real-world image data.
