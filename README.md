# 🐱🐶 Cats-vs-Dogs Image Classifier

> **A Deep Learning adventure to distinguish cats and dogs using TensorFlow & Keras!**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images of cats and dogs — the classic AI challenge!  
By training on a diverse dataset of photos, the model learns to spot the unique features of each animal and classify new images with high accuracy.

## 🧩 Key Features & Workflow

- 🎨 **Data Preprocessing & Augmentation**  
  Enhance the dataset by applying transformations like rotation, scaling, and flipping to make the model robust against variations.

- 🏗️ **CNN Architecture**  
  Constructed with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers — capturing intricate patterns and textures of cats and dogs.

- 📈 **Model Training & Evaluation**  
  Monitored with metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, and **recall** to ensure reliable and balanced performance.

- 📊 **Visualizations**  
  Interactive plots and graphs showcasing training progress, loss curves, and confusion matrices to deeply understand model behavior.

## 🎯 What’s Next?

- Experiment with **transfer learning** using pre-trained models like ResNet or EfficientNet.  
- Deploy the model as a web app with an intuitive UI for real-time classification.  
- Explore explainability techniques to understand what the model "sees" in each image.
